Revision history for Perl extension Sendmail::PMilter.

0.90  Thu Feb 19 16:20:00 2004 UTC
	- first release of new architecture based on legacy codebase

0.91  Sun Feb 22 15:20:00 2004 UTC
	- added PMILTER_DISPATCHER env var
	- added "ithread" and "prefork" dispatchers
	- major doc overhaul
	- moved sources to "lib"

0.92  Fri Feb 27 15:15:00 2004 UTC
	- added INET6 and UNIX socket support to sockaddr argument passed
		to the "connect" callback
	- fixed bug where a setreply() value was held beyond one callback
		(also fixed in 0.91_02)
	- implemented Sendmail::Milter::settimeout() and
		Sendmail::Milter::setdbg() as no-ops; needed for completeness
		(also fixed in 0.91_03)
	- fixed signal handling in prefork dispatcher

0.93  Thu Mar 25 19:15:00 2004 UTC
	- fixed call to threads::shared::share() to pass varglob, not
		reference (reported by <schaefer@zanshin.com>)
		(also fixed in 0.92_01)
	- [910599] fixed SIGINFO handler to use only a valid signal; will use
		SIGUSR1 if SIGINFO doesn't exist
		(also fixed in 0.92_01)
	- [910602] always send a response to the close packet if the socket
		is still valid (was doing this for failures, but not for
		successful closing of the session)
	- [923156] moved constants from Sendmail::PMilter to Sendmail::Milter
		to allow the libmilter implementation to coexist
