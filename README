Sendmail::PMilter version 0.91
==============================

$Id: README,v 1.7 2004/02/22 14:54:29 tvierling Exp $

Sendmail::PMilter is a mail filtering API implementing the Sendmail
milter protocol in pure Perl.  This allows Sendmail servers (and perhaps
other MTAs implementing milter) to filter and modify mail in transit
during the SMTP connection, all in Perl.

It should be noted that PMilter 0.90 and later is NOT compatible with
scripts written for PMilter 0.5 and earlier.  The API has been reworked
significantly, and the enhanced APIs and rule logic provided by PMilter
0.5 and earlier has been factored out for inclusion in a separate package
to be called Mail::Milter.

0.91 significantly improves documentation, and introduces the "prefork"
and "ithread" dispatchers, allowing for more resource-efficient milter
implementations.  The dispatcher used may be set with the
PMILTER_DISPATCHER environment variable for easier use with milters using
the Sendmail::Milter compatibility API.  See "perldoc Sendmail::PMilter"
for details.

               NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

       This version of Sendmail::PMilter is NOT well tested.
       All versions in the 0.xx series WILL have bugs, so
       USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
